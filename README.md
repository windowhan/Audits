## About
I am an independent security researcher specializing in smart contract + Blockchain audits.

Currently, I am a Security Auditor at Kalos Security.

I have uploaded the reports I wrote in each folder, not just in the README.md. It's a reference material for when you consider hiring me.

If you need security consulting on ERC-4337, LSD, Bridge, Chain, or DeFi, please contact me:
